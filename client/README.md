# Chomping Grounds

Welcome to Chomping Grounds! This is a React app where you can search for any animal and find out whether it is a carnivore, herbivore, or omnivore. In addition, the app will list out its predator or prey, and you can click on the main animal image to get more facts. You can also click on any of the predator or prey animals to conduct a new search against that animal.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.

## Using the App

Once the app is up and running, you can use the search bar to search for an animal. Simply type in the name of the animal and hit enter. The app will then return whether the animal is a carnivore, herbivore, or omnivore, along with a list of its predators or prey.

To learn more about the animal, click on the main animal image. This will take you to a page with additional facts and information about the animal.

If you want to search for one of the predator or prey animals listed on the search results page, simply click on its name. This will conduct a new search for that animal.
